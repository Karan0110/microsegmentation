# Areas for Improvement

## My Code 

* Check over the parameters with biologist (especially where we used typical value readouts from ChatGPT)
* The fluorophores are currently modelled as "blobs" (as there are too many), is this the best way?
* We aren't using z-position for the PSF
* Make the z-slice position variable (instead of fixed proportion)

## Tubulaton

* Change parameter names in config.ini
