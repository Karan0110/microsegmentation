# Poster Topics

* Background?
* Generation pipeline:
	* How it works
	* Images of example synthetic data 
* Explanation of NN? (But nothing original here, and probably uninteresting to the target audience):
	* Put a picture of U-Net diagram? 
* An actual answer to the question of where the network repolys from
* Results:
	* Demo for synthetic data
	* Demo for experimental data
	* Unless the results from overnight run are unexpected - show a proper demo for a time series using t=0 to calibrate threshold (Otsu should probably work)
* Comparisons

# Questions

* Any tips for using Inkscape?
* Any templates for posters?
